Added:
    Misc:
        Added a map class to be able to load maps.
    game:
        Added self.dt which is used for delta time.
        Added self.is_paused which is used to check if the player pauses the game.
        Added self.c_map which referenced to the current map.
        Added a main folder reference.
        Added references to load_maps and get_level:
            this is to call those functions.
        Added basic functionality to the run_game functions.
    Added a map_class file:
        This is to process, load and navigate maps via the reference in the python file called game.
    Added maps file to hold the maps variable:
        This is to make it easier to find where to add a map reference after adding one to the maps folder.

Changed:
    Misc:
        The file structure so that all folders and file names have no capitals.
        The way the print statements look e.g.,
            Rather than just printing the variable it prints where the statement is
    Main:
        un-commented the OS import in main as it's now being used.
    base_sprite_class and wall_class:
        changed the parameters from with and height (w,h) to dimensions as this will pass in both the width and height.
    game:
        Changed the parameters in the __init__ method to allow the main file to be passed in.
        Changed the load_maps method to better streamline it.

Removed:
    In wall_class:
        The importation of pygame as it's not required.
